This is a repository for my Society for Personality and Social Psychology 2024 poster **Couples of Color Have Higher Interest Rate Mortgages than White Couples**. I will be presenting this research on February 10th, 2024 in San Diego, CA. 

## Acitvity Description

While the Fair Housing Act (1968) prohibits housing discrimination by race, discrimination may persist. Using Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data (N = 18,660,724 couples), we test whether couples of color (e.g., couples where at least one partner is a person of color) have higher interest mortgages than White couples. And more, we examine if same-race couples of color (e.g., couples where both partners are people of color) have higher interest rates than interracial couples (i.e., Black/Black vs. Black/White). Overall, we find that a greater share of American Indian, Black, Latinx, and Pacific Islander couples of color have higher interest rate mortgages than White couples. In comparisons controlling for other demographic and mortgage information between same-race and interracial couples of color, we find that Black and Pacific Islander same-race couples have higher interest rates than Black and Pacific Islander interracial couples and that this relationship is mixed (reversed/non-significant) for American Indian, Asian, and Latinx same-race couples. These findings reveal that despite fair housing policies, couples of color still receive less favorable loan terms than White couples.

## Data Description

### Data Source Availability Statement

Data used in this exercise were obtained through the U.S. [(HMDA)](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-publication/2022) website. Access is free and universal.

### Codebook and Data

The multi-year HMDA data consists of three separate datasets from 2018, 2019, and 2020. There is not concatenated dataset for download. Therefore, you must download each data set, process, and combine them prior to analysis.

Access to the codebook for each year can be found [here](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/documentation/publications/loan-level-datasets/lar-data-fields).

### Software, Packages, and Applications for Wrangling and Analysis

I used RStudio (2023.12.0+369) as my statistical software for this activity. The wrangling and analyses conducted in the reposited files required the installation and use of several R packages including tidyverse and usmaps. 

## Other Requirements

### Time

Total processing time takes less than one hour. Starting from scratch takes approximately 5-6 hours if unacquainted with the data.

### Computing 

The wrangling, analysis, and documentation required of this activity was done on macOS Sonoma v 14.2.1 with a Apple M2 Pro Chip and 16 GB memory.
